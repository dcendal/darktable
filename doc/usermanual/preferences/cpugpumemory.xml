  <para>
    These options control how darktable use your system resources.
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">memory in megabytes to use for thumbnail cache</bridgehead>

  <para>
    In order to speed-up display of film rolls, darktable stores thumbnails in a cache file on
    disk (primary cache) and loads it into memory at startup. This value controls the cache size
    in megabytes. It needs a restart if changed (default 256MB).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">enable disk backend for thumbnail cache</bridgehead>

  <para>
    If activated darktable stores all thumbnails on disk as a secondary cache, and thereby
    keeping thumbnails accessible in case they get dropped from the primary cache. This needs
    more disk space but speeds up lighttable view as it avoids reprocessing of thumbnails
    (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">enable disk backend for full preview cache</bridgehead>

  <para>
    If enabled, darktable write full preview to disk (.cache/darktable/) when evicted from the memory cache.
    Note that this can take a lot of memory (several gigabytes for 20k images) and darktable will never delete cached images.
    It's safe though to delete these manually, if you want.
    Lighttable performance will be increased greatly when zooming image in full preview mode (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">number of background threads</bridgehead>

  <para>
    This controls how many parallel threads are used to create thumbnails during import. On
    32bit systems it is strongly recommended to set this to 1. Needs a restart if changed
    (default 2).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">host memory limit (in MB) for tiling</bridgehead>

  <para>
    In order to manage large images on systems with limited memory darktable does tile-wise
    processing. This variable controls the <emphasis>maximum</emphasis> amount of memory (in MB)
    a module may use during image processing. Lower values will force memory hungry modules to
    process an image with increasing number of tiles. Setting this to 0 will omit any limits.
    Values below 500 will be treated as 500. On a 32bit system you should set this to 500. Needs
    a restart if changed (default 1500).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">minimum amount of memory (in MB) for a single buffer in tiling</bridgehead>

  <para>
    If set to a positive, non-zero value, this variable defines the <emphasis>minimum</emphasis>
    amount of memory (in MB) that darktable should take for a single tile. On a 32bit system you
    should set this to 8. 64bit systems can live with higher values. Needs a restart if changed
    (default 16).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">activate OpenCL support</bridgehead>

  <para>
    darktable can use your GPU to speed up processing significantly. Interface OpenCL requires
    suitable hardware and matching OpenCL drivers on your system. If one of those is not found
    the option is greyed out. Can be switched on and off at any time and takes immediate effect
    (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect5">OpenCL scheduling profile</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Defines how preview and full pixelpipe tasks are scheduled on OpenCL enabled systems.
    <quote>default</quote>: the GPU processes the center view pixelpipe and the CPU processes
    the preview pipe; <quote>multiple GPUs</quote>: both pixelpipes are processed in parallel on
    two different GPUs; <quote>very fast GPU</quote>: both pixelpipes are processed sequentially
    on the GPU.
  </para>
