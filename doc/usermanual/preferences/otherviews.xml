    These options control the other views: map and slideshow.

  <sect2 id="map">

    <title>map/geolocalisation</title>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">only draw images on map that are currently collected and filtered</bridgehead>

    <para>
      Use the current filter settings to select the geotagged images drawn in the map view. This
      limits the images drawn to those currently shown in the filmstrip and thus reduces the time
      needed (default off).
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">maximum number of images drawn on map</bridgehead>

    <para>
      The maximum number of geotagged images drawn on the map. Increasing this number can slow
      down the drawing of the map. Needs a restart if changed (default 100).
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">pretty print the image location</bridgehead>

    <para>
      Show a more readable representation of the geo location in the image information module
      (default on).
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="slideshow">

    <title>slideshow</title>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">waiting time before each picture in slideshow</bridgehead>

    <para>
      The number of seconds before displaying the next image (default 5).
    </para>
    
    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">do high quality processing for slideshow</bridgehead>

    <para>
      Controls how images are processed for the slideshow view. It this option is enabled, the
      image will first be processed in full resolution, and downscaled at the very end. This can
      result in better quality sometimes, but will always be slower (default on).
