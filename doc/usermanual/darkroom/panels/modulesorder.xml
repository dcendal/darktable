              This is the new module order which has been introduced with
              version 3.0 and has been made the default. This new module order
              has been designed to give better rendering of colors and in
              general better quality.

  <para>
    As for most modules it is possible to create presets. The new
    preset will register the current module order of the pipe. This
    module order can then be selected to edit other images. Note that
    the module order can be copied from one image to another when
    copying history and can also be recorded as part of a style.
